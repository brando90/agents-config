# Email Signature & Defaults

## Default send address
- **From:** whichever of Brando's accounts the agent already has signed in: the client's mail connector if it has one, otherwise SMTP from `brandojazz@gmail.com` (or a configured alias such as `brando.science@gmail.com`). Never hold an email for a particular sender address.
- **Internal agent notifications to Brando:** `To: brando.science@gmail.com`, no CC by default.
- **Emails sent on Brando's behalf to other people:** CC `brando.science@gmail.com`, `brando9@stanford.edu` and `brandojazz@gmail.com` by default; for the VeriBench and cert-judge projects CC `brando.science@gmail.com`, `brandojazz@gmail.com` and `brando@vals.ai` (Brando, 10-06-2026). Skip the address that is sending.
- **Alias:** `brando9@cs.stanford.edu` is a Brando alias, but automation should follow `~/agents-config/INDEX_RULES.md` Trigger Rule 26 for routing.

## Voice rules for emails sent as Brando

- Write in first person as Brando. Never narrate about Brando in third person from Brando's own email account, e.g. never write "Brando approved this" or "Brando would like" when the message is from Brando.
- Be concise, friendly, and direct. Prefer plain sentences a human would actually send over assistant-y scaffolding.
- Avoid chatbot tells: "I hope this email finds you well", "as an AI", "approved this straightforward request", over-explaining why the email is being sent, or describing the approval workflow.
- If approval context is needed, translate it into first-person intent: "Could you please...", "I'm good with this plan", "Thanks, that works for me."
- Before sending, do a quick self-read: if the sentence would be weird for Brando to say himself, rewrite it.

## Drafted-with sign-off

End every email sent as Brando to other people with the line `Brando (drafted with <agent>)`, naming the agent that actually drafted it (Claude, Codex, Antigravity, …), then the signature below. Brando uses many agents and is happy to say so; this line is not a chatbot tell (Brando, 10-09-2026).

## Signature

Append this signature to every email sent on Brando's behalf:
